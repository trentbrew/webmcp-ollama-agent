## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Basic knowledge of Svelte 5, TypeScript, and Chrome Extensions

### Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/svelte5-chrome-extension.git
   cd svelte5-chrome-extension
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```
4. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:

- `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feature/shadow-dom-support`)
- `fix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/icon-rendering-issue`)
- `docs/` - Documentation updates (e.g., `docs/add-api-reference`)
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/component-structure`)
- `test/` - Adding or updating tests (e.g., `test/add-unit-tests`)
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`)

### Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server with HMR
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Type check
npm run check

# Lint
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Testing Your Changes

Substantive changes follow the empirical wedge practice in
[`docs/issues/README.md`](docs/issues/README.md): a spec with executable
acceptance criteria, a regression test observed red before the fix, and a journal
recording what was actually run.

Climb the evidence ladder as far as the change's risk demands:

| Rung | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Static | `just check` |
| Unit | `just unit` |
| Live tab | `just smoke` |
| Manual | `just test`, then reload at `chrome://extensions/` |

`just verify` runs the first two together.

Manual verification is legitimate, but only when written into the issue journal
with what was clicked and what was observed:

1. Build the extension: `pnpm build`
2. Load the `dist/` folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome
3. Test all affected functionality
4. Verify no console errors
5. Check that existing features still work

---

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

**Never push directly to `master`.** Always work on a feature branch.

```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow existing code style
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update documentation if needed
